Random NPC generator
Plug con bonuses into the hp generator
	note ninja special case con bonus (and Ranger, Monk and Cav?)
		ninjas get no con bonus / full con bonus to other class
		otherwise as multiclass
	need to add age-adjustment method
Good start on leveling system, but we need:
	a method for incrementing levels
	0th level
	leveling event caps (snipping off the extra xp)
	de-leveling method
	class demotion method
		this actually needs to be a return from attributes.py
	need to find the > in level-up and make it a >=


Completed:
	Separate out the attribute generator into a module
	Separate the str percentile into a separate (8th?) attribute
	need to replace xlwt with either an Excel 10 module or else stick to CSVs
	converted most of the thresholds in attributes.py to csv

multi_sequencer variables:
	6 lists (nineDsix, temp1, temp2, temp3, final & ordered_list)
	4 integers (i, j, num_classes, current_val)
		ordered_list = [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
		num_classes = the # of classes entered
		nineDsix = a method V list for each class entered: [[9, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6, 4], [7, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 3]]
		i, j & current_val = 0
